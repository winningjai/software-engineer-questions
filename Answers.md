1. What’s your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or something
   you’ve worked on professionally. Just a short paragraph is fine, but I’d
   love to know why you’re proud of it.

>> With close to 1.5 years of experience, I was moved to AWS cloudformation based Microservice deployment tool. Within 3 months, I have analysed and fixed the month old production issue(Developed an Infrastructure scaling guide for the Microservice) in our microservice. 
Also, onboarded the Prometheus based monitoring with pagerduty to monitor the service status. This monitoring solution helps us in a lot of ways like identifying the service load and proactively notify us. Achieving this kind of work in less than 3 months after onboarding the project will always make me proud and to add to this, within a year I have started owning this microservice deployment single-handed.

2. What's a personal project you're currently working on? This could be a
   coding side project, hobby, or otherwise real world project you're working
   on.

>> Nothing specifically, I used to explore different DevOps tools and spend time on learning newer things like different deployment architectures and now, I am spending time on learning Kubernetes which is pretty new to me.

3. Tell us about a technical book or article you read recently, why you liked
   it, and why we should read it.

>> Not a book reader, if someone asks for any technical suggestion in the DevOps field, The Kubernetes course by Mumshad is pretty clean and good stuff that I prefer to share.

4. Tell us about one of your favorite products (physical or software) and one
   specific aspect that makes it truly great.

>> I have developed a sync microservice, which will be used by one of the crucial solutions in Genesys. The sync service will use Objectivefs to mount the remote files(AWS S3, Azure storage) and it will run the rsync Linux process the sync the files from the cloud to instance/pod local storage. So, the Genesys solution can access the files in less than a few seconds.
